### Deduct Tokens

Deducts tokens from a user\'s account. This returns the new balance and deducts the tokens from the user\'s account. You should look to warn the user when they are low on tokens, encouraging them to top up.

- **URL**: `/api/tokens/deduct`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Headers**:
  - `X-Developer-API-Key`: Your Developer API Key
  - `X-User-Connection-Key`: User Connection Key
  - `Content-Type`: `application/json`

#### Request Body

```json filename="deduct-body.json" copy
{
  "amount": number, // required - the amount of tokens to deduct
  "multiplier": number (optional, default: 1.0), // optional - the multiplier to apply to the amount
  "model": string (optional), // optional - the model to deduct tokens for
  "label": string (optional) // optional - a label for the deduction
}
```

#### Response

```json filename="deduct-response.json" copy
{
  "success": boolean, // true if the deduction was successful, false otherwise
  "newBalance": number, // the new balance of the user
  "message": string, // a message about the deduction
  "deductedAmount": number // the amount of tokens that were deducted
}
```

#### Error Response

The system can return the following errors:
The API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of requests:

- 200: Success
- 400: Bad Request - The request was invalid or cannot be served. The exact error message can be found in the response body.
- 401: Unauthorized - The request requires authentication which was not supplied.
- 404: Not Found - The requested resource could not be found.
- 429: Too Many Requests - The request was rate-limited.
- 500: Internal Server Error - Something went wrong on our end.

For 400 errors, it usually includes an error message that can be found in the response body. This is usually caused by insufficient tokens and the user should be directed to your app page, which includes their token balance and a link to top up.

```json filename="deduct-error-response.json" copy
{
  "error": string
}
```
