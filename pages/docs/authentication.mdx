# Authentication

All API requests must be authenticated using two keys:

1. Your Developer API Key - a key generated for your app when you create it
2. A User Connection Key - a key generated by each user when they connect to your app

Include these keys in the headers of your requests:

```http
X-Developer-API-Key: YOUR_DEVELOPER_API_KEY
X-User-Connection-Key: USER_CONNECTION_KEY
```
